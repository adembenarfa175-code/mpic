### 🛑 Critical Clause for MPIC Closed Source Copyright Enforcement

**Notwithstanding the above, the following terms apply exclusively to the Closed Source components (e.g., `src/core/core_check.asm` and the security file `FILECPUROOTUESR.RFC`) which are NOT covered by the MIT license:**

1.  **Exclusive Ownership:** The Closed Source components are the exclusive intellectual property of MPIC Closed Source Copyright.
2.  **Prohibited Actions (Copying/Tampering):** Any form of **copying, pasting, reverse-engineering, opening, or attempting to modify** any part of the Closed Source code is strictly and permanently forbidden.
3.  **Consequences:** Any attempt to violate this clause, detected by the processor's **Triple Intent Verification** mechanism, will immediately trigger the **"Security Guardian"** warning, followed by the **"Catastrophic Alarm"** (audible/visual), culminating in the **Self-Disable** mechanism (fuse-burning) to permanently incapacitate the computer.
4.  **Taxes/Fees:** The Closed Source code may **not** be used, included, or derived in any other project without paying the mandatory ** licensing tax** and obtaining prior written permission.
